      <p><h2 style={{textTransform: "uppercase", marginBottom: 12, fontSize: "150%"}}>A safe community is our priority.</h2></p>
      <p>A community where anyone can feel comfortable and safe requires a set of consistent expectations of Instructors&rsquo; and Users&rsquo; behavior. Clear expectations are the foundation of trust. Our Community Standards should be used to help guide behavior and are the codified values that underpin our global community.</p>
      <p>This is a living document; we are constantly refining our approach to better meet the needs of our community. Safety, security, fairness, authenticity, and reliability, however, will always remain central pillars in our efforts to help ensure safety and fostering belonging. We are vigilant about these standards being upheld and enforced.</p>
      <p><strong>Safety</strong></p>
      <p>Your Teache experience begins the moment you decide to learn something new. Taking that leap is only possible when you trust the Teache community and feel safe with us. Accordingly, we require that you, as either a User or an Instructor, refrain from endangering or threatening anyone at any time.</p>
      <p><strong>Harm</strong></p>
      <p>You should not commit physical or sexual assault, sexual abuse, sexual harassment, domestic violence, robbery, human trafficking, or other acts of violence or hold anyone against their will. Members of dangerous organizations, including terrorists, organized criminals, and violent racist groups, are not welcome in this community. Teache works with law enforcement as appropriate and responds to valid law enforcement requests.</p>
      <p>We take suicide, self-injury, eating disorders, and hard drug abuse seriously. We always work to help people in crisis to the best of our abilities,</p>
      <p><strong>Threats</strong></p>
      <p>You should not convey an intent to harm anyone via words or physical actions, ever. We take threats of self-harm just as seriously, and we may intervene if we become aware of a credible threat.</p>
      <p><strong>Hazardous situations</strong></p>
      <p>You should not have unsecured weapons, dangerous animals, or any potential disease risks in your class. You should not engage in either actions or negligence that increases the likelihood of a fire or would impede escape in the event of an emergency at a class&rsquo;s location.</p>
      <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
      <p>Our Teache community members share their expertise and experience. Whether you are teaching something new as an Instructor or experiencing an Instructor&rsquo;s class as a User, you should be confident that you will be and feel secure. Always respect others&rsquo; information and belongings.</p>
      <p><strong>Theft &amp; extortion</strong></p>
      <p>Do not take property that is not yours, copy others&rsquo; identity documents, or threaten anyone with bad ratings or any other penalty or harm to obtain compensation or other benefits.</p>
      <p><strong>Spam &amp; fraud</strong></p>
      <p>You should not make transactions outside of Teache's payments system; commit booking fraud, credit card fraud, or launder money; attempt to drive traffic to other sites or unrelated market products; divert payments meant for others; abuse our referrals system; or make false claims against other members of the community.</p>
      <p><strong>Community privacy or intellectual property rights</strong></p>
      <p>You should not spy on other people: cameras are not permitted in your class unless they are previously disclosed and visible. Cameras are never permitted in private spaces (such as bathrooms or changing rooms). You should not access others&rsquo; accounts without authorization or violate others&rsquo; privacy, copyrights, or trademarks.</p>
      <p><strong>Fairness</strong></p>
      <p>The Teache community is diverse and unique. Fairness makes it possible for us to trust one another, integrate and create an environment where learning can be cultivated.</p>
      <p><strong>Discriminatory behavior </strong></p>
      <p>Treat everyone with respect in every interaction. You should follow all applicable laws and not treat others differently because of their race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, or state of health. Insulting others on these bases is forbidden.</p>
      <p><strong>Bullying or harassing </strong></p>
      <p>You should not share personal information to shame or blackmail others, target others with unwanted behavior, defame others, or violate our review and content standards.</p>
      <p><strong>Disturbing the community</strong></p>
      <p>Refrain from disturbing the community or creating a pervasive nuisance for those around you. Be responsive and respectful to community concerns.</p>
      <p><strong>Authenticity</strong></p>
      <p>Our focus is for your experience to be unique and fulfilling. Trust and authenticity are essential in our community. Trust requires a balance of shared expectations, honest interactions, and accurate details.</p>
      <p><strong>Misrepresenting yourself</strong></p>
      <p>You should provide a correct name and information. Do not maintain duplicate accounts or create an account if you are under the age of 18. You should not misrepresent your experience level as either an Instructor or a User.</p>
      <p><strong>Misrepresenting your class</strong></p>
      <p>You must provide accurate location information, availability, and information about the type, nature, or details of your Class. You may not substitute one listing for another, set up fake or fraudulent listings, leave fraudulent reviews, engage in deceptive pricing, or fail to disclose hazards and accessibility issues.</p>
      <p><strong>Reliability</strong></p>
      <p>Since our community of Users make commitments based on the description of a Class, those descriptions must be accurate. We also expect Instructors offer prompt and friendly responses when Users ask them questions.</p>
      <p><strong>Breaking commitments</strong></p>
      <p>Instructors and Users should not cancel a Class within one (1) hour of the class start time. As a User, you should not fail to pay and should not break the Instructor&rsquo;s Class rules.</p>
      <p><strong>Being unresponsive</strong></p>
      <p>You should not have persistently low ratings, be unresponsive during booking, fail to provide an adequate point of contact for Instructors, or refuse to participate in our resolution process.</p>
